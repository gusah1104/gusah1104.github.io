As someone particularly interested in history, especially the history of the Near East, I decided that my first travel destination would be the eastern Mediterranean. The thought of seeing ancient Egyptian, Mesopotamian, Persian, and Roman ruins that I had only read about in books since childhood filled me with excitement.

    These are sites I went in Levant. On the left is Temple of Bacchus in Baalbek, Lebannon. On the middle is rare phoneician remantns in Sidon, Lebanon. On the right is Petra in Jordan.

Places like the Karnak Temple in Luxor and Petra in Jordan—remnants of once-glorious cities—left me deep in thought. I would often sit alone at these sites for hours, imagining what they might have looked like in their prime. Looking at the ruins, now crumbling and buried in the sands of the desert, I couldn’t help but reflect on how all of life seems as fleeting as the morning dew.
