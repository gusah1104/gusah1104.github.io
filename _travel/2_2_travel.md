The term "Age of Discovery" carries a romantic allure. My interest in this era began during a trip to Peru when I was in middle school. It was a time when explorers ventured into the unknown, erasing blank spaces from the map. Of course, for the indigenous people, it marked the beginning of a brutal colonial era. Yet, the stories of hundreds of conquistadors toppling empires of millions fascinated me and sparked my curiosity about this complex and transformative period in history.

대항해시대라는 말은 낭만적이다. 내가 처음 이것에 관심을 가지게 된것은 중학생때 페루를 여행했을때다. 미지의 세계를 탐험하며, 지도상의 공백을 지우는 시대. 물론 원주민에게는 잔혹한 식민시대의 시작이였겠지만, 수백명의 콩키스타도르가 수백만의 제국을 무너트리거나 하는 등의 역사는 나에게 매우 흥미로웠다.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images, even citations {% cite einstein1950meaning %}.
Say you wanted to write a bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.
