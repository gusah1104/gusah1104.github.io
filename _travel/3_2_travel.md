The most fascinating place I visited in Iran was the Tower of Silence in Yazd. The thought that human corpses were once actually left here to be consumed by birds was both eerie and captivating. During the COVID era, I was the only tourist there, and the sense of solitude—feeling as if I were the only person within a 10-kilometer radius—sent shivers down my spine.

In the end, everyone is destined to die. It made me ponder: how should I live the rest of my life?

이란에서 가장 흥미로웠던 곳은 야즈드의 조장터였다. 이곳에서 실제로 사람의 시체가 새에게 뜯어먹혔다니. 코로나 시기라 관광객이 오직 나 혼자이고, 주변 10km에 사람이 나 밖에 없는 것 같은 느낌이 나를 오싹하게 했다. 
결국 모든 사람은 죽게 마련. 나는 남은 인생을 어떻게 살아가면 좋을까?
