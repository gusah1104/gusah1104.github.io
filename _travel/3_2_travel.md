The most fascinating place I visited in Iran was the Tower of Silence in Yazd. The thought that human corpses were once actually left here to be consumed by birds was both eerie and captivating. During the COVID era, I was the only tourist there, and the sense of solitude—feeling as if I were the only person within a 10-kilometer radius—sent shivers down my spine.

In the end, everyone is destined to die. It made me ponder: how should I live the rest of my life?
