The most challenging aspect of traveling in Iran was dealing with the impact of COVID-19. After the virus began in China, it rapidly spread in Iran, partially due to Chinese laborers working in the country. As an East Asian traveler, the environment was particularly harsh for me. People would openly confront me on the streets, some even hurling insults. Eating in restaurants was difficult due to the stares and judgmental looks, and many hotels outright refused to accommodate me.

It’s surprising, considering that Iran had a reputation for being exceptionally hospitable to travelers before the pandemic. This experience significantly diminished my interest in studying people. Up until then, I had been deeply fascinated by history and the human stories within it, but after this, I found myself drawn to more fundamental questions—questions not rooted in humanity, but in something deeper.
